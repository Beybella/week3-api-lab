# Week 3 Laboratory API Development and Microservices 1

This project is a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express. We also implemented a JWT-based authentication to create and test API endpoints using Postman. 

# Features 

    *User Registration and Login (server.js and auth-service.js)
    *JWT Authentication for secure routes (server.js and auth-service.js)
    *Product Management Microservice (product-service.js)

# Run the services 
    Run the authentication services on their respective ports
    ** node auth-service.js
    ** product-service.js
